## **UNPKG**

[UNPKG](https://unpkg.com/browse/bootstrap-nice-select@1.4.0/) is a CDN open source project powered by Cloudfare to distribute everything on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). Use it to quickly and easily load any file from any package using a URL like notation.

{% highlight html %}
<!-- Latest compiled and minified CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/bootstrap-nice-select@1.4.0/dist/css/bootstrap-nice-select.min.css">

<!-- Latest compiled and minified JavaScript -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/bootstrap-nice-select@1.4.0/dist/js/bootstrap-nice-select.min.js"></script>
{% endhighlight %}

<div class="alert alert-light d-flex align-items-center font-size-13 my-3" role="alert">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info pe-2"></i>
    <div>
    The CDN is updated after the release is made public, which means that there is probably a delay between the publishing of a release and its availability on the CDN.
